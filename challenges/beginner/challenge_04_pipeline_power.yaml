  # Pipeline Power Challenge
  
  Now it's time to test your PowerShell pipeline skills! This challenge will reinforce what you learned in the "Building Command Chains: PowerShell Pipelines" tutorial.
  
  ## Your Task
  
  Write a single PowerShell pipeline (a command chain connected with | symbols) that does ALL of the following:
  
  1. Get all services on the computer
  2. Filter to only show services that are currently running
  3. Filter again to only show services that start automatically
  4. Sort the services alphabetically by display name
  5. Select only the DisplayName, Status, and StartType properties
  6. Limit the result to the first 10 services
  
  Hints:
  - Start with Get-Service
  - Use Where-Object twice with different conditions
  - For automatic startup, filter where StartType equals "Automatic"
  - Use Sort-Object for alphabetical sorting
  - Use Select-Object to choose specific properties
  - Use Select-Object with -First parameter to limit results
  
  Good luck!

solution: "Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -EQ 'Running' | Where-Object -Property StartType -EQ 'Automatic' | Sort-Object -Property DisplayName | Select-Object -Property DisplayName, Status, StartType -First 10"
validation_type: "fuzzy"
hint: "Start with Get-Service, pipe to Where-Object twice to filter on both Status and StartType, pipe to Sort-Object for alphabetical sorting, then pipe to Select-Object to choose properties and limit results."
