  # File System Navigation Challenge
  
  Now it's time to put your file system navigation skills to the test! This challenge will reinforce what you learned in the "Exploring Your Computer: Finding Your Way" tutorial.
  
  ## Your Task
  
  Write a PowerShell command chain that accomplishes ALL of the following:
  
  1. Navigate to the C:\Windows\System32 directory
  2. List all files with a ".exe" extension
  3. Sort them by size (largest first)
  4. Display only the top 5 largest files
  5. Show only their Name and Length (size) properties
  
  Hints:
  - You'll need to use Set-Location (or cd) to change directories
  - Use Get-ChildItem with a filter parameter or wildcard
  - Use Sort-Object with -Descending parameter
  - Use Select-Object with -First parameter
  
  Good luck!

solution: "Set-Location C:\\Windows\\System32; Get-ChildItem -Filter *.exe | Sort-Object -Property Length -Descending | Select-Object -Property Name, Length -First 5"
validation_type: "fuzzy"
hint: "First navigate to the directory with Set-Location or cd, then use Get-ChildItem with a filter, pipe to Sort-Object for sorting by size, and finally pipe to Select-Object to limit the properties and number of results."
