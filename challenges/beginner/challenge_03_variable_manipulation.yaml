  # Variable Manipulation Challenge
  
  Time to test your knowledge of PowerShell variables! This challenge will help reinforce what you learned in the "Remembering Information: Using Variables" tutorial.
  
  ## Your Task
  
  Write a series of PowerShell commands that does ALL of the following:
  
  1. Create a variable called $computerInfo that stores the result of the Get-ComputerInfo command
  2. Create a variable called $osName that extracts just the OS Name from $computerInfo (hint: use the property WindowsProductName)
  3. Create a variable called $totalMemory that extracts the total physical memory in GB from $computerInfo, rounded to 2 decimal places
  4. Display a message that reads: "This computer is running [OS NAME] with [X.XX] GB of RAM"
  
  Hints:
  - The property for total physical memory is CsTotalPhysicalMemory
  - You'll need to convert bytes to GB (divide by 1GB) and use the [math]::Round() function
  - 1GB = 1073741824 bytes
  - Double quotes allow variable expansion inside strings
  
  Good luck!

solution: "$computerInfo = Get-ComputerInfo; $osName = $computerInfo.WindowsProductName; $totalMemory = [math]::Round($computerInfo.CsTotalPhysicalMemory / 1GB, 2); \"This computer is running $osName with $totalMemory GB of RAM\""
validation_type: "fuzzy"
hint: "Start with storing Get-ComputerInfo in a variable, then extract the OS name and memory into separate variables, use math functions to convert and round the memory value, and finally use string interpolation to display the message."
