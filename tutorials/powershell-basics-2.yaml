  # PowerShell Basics: Part 2

  ## Functions
  Functions in PowerShell allow you to reuse code:

  ```powershell
  function Say-Hello {
      param(
          [string]$Name = "World"
      )
      
      Write-Host "Hello, $Name!"
  }

  Say-Hello
  Say-Hello -Name "PowerShell"
  ```

  ## Conditionals
  PowerShell supports if-else statements:

  ```powershell
  $age = 25

  if ($age -lt 18) {
      Write-Host "You are a minor."
  } elseif ($age -ge 65) {
      Write-Host "You are a senior."
  } else {
      Write-Host "You are an adult."
  }
  ```

  ## Loops
  PowerShell has several types of loops:

  ### ForEach-Object
  ```powershell
  1..5 | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "Number: $_" }
  ```

  ### ForEach
  ```powershell
  foreach ($number in 1..5) {
      Write-Host "Number: $number"
  }
  ```

  ### For
  ```powershell
  for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
      Write-Host "Number: $i"
  }
  ```

  ## Try It Yourself
  1. Create a function that takes a number and returns its square
  2. Write a loop that prints the squares of numbers 1 through 10
  3. Create a conditional statement that checks if a number is even or odd
