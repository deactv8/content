  # Conditional Logic Challenge
  
  Time to put your conditional logic skills to the test! This challenge will reinforce what you learned in the "Making Decisions: PowerShell Conditionals" tutorial.
  
  ## Your Task
  
  Write a PowerShell script that does ALL of the following:
  
  1. Get the current hour using (Get-Date).Hour
  2. Get the amount of free disk space on the C: drive in GB using:
     (Get-PSDrive C).Free / 1GB
  3. Display a different message based on BOTH the time of day AND the available disk space:
     - If it's before noon (hour < 12):
       - If free space is less than 10GB: "Good morning! Warning: Low disk space!"
       - If free space is between 10GB and 50GB: "Good morning! Disk space is adequate."
       - If free space is more than 50GB: "Good morning! Plenty of disk space available."
     - If it's afternoon (hour between 12 and 17):
       - If free space is less than 10GB: "Good afternoon! Warning: Low disk space!"
       - If free space is between 10GB and 50GB: "Good afternoon! Disk space is adequate."
       - If free space is more than 50GB: "Good afternoon! Plenty of disk space available."
     - If it's evening (hour 18 or later):
       - If free space is less than 10GB: "Good evening! Warning: Low disk space!"
       - If free space is between 10GB and 50GB: "Good evening! Disk space is adequate."
       - If free space is more than 50GB: "Good evening! Plenty of disk space available."
  
  Hints:
  - Use variables to store the current hour and free disk space
  - Use nested if/elseif/else statements for the time and disk space conditions
  - Remember to use -lt, -le, -gt, -ge for comparisons
  - Round the disk space value to make it more readable
  
  Good luck!

solution: "$hour = (Get-Date).Hour; $freeSpace = [math]::Round((Get-PSDrive C).Free / 1GB, 2); if ($hour -lt 12) { if ($freeSpace -lt 10) { \"Good morning! Warning: Low disk space!\" } elseif ($freeSpace -le 50) { \"Good morning! Disk space is adequate.\" } else { \"Good morning! Plenty of disk space available.\" } } elseif ($hour -lt 18) { if ($freeSpace -lt 10) { \"Good afternoon! Warning: Low disk space!\" } elseif ($freeSpace -le 50) { \"Good afternoon! Disk space is adequate.\" } else { \"Good afternoon! Plenty of disk space available.\" } } else { if ($freeSpace -lt 10) { \"Good evening! Warning: Low disk space!\" } elseif ($freeSpace -le 50) { \"Good evening! Disk space is adequate.\" } else { \"Good evening! Plenty of disk space available.\" } }"
validation_type: "fuzzy"
hint: "Start by storing the current hour and free disk space in variables. Then use nested if statements - first to check the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), then within each time block, check the disk space condition."
