    title: Meet Your Terminal
    instructions: |
      👋 Hey there, explorer!
      Welcome to PowerShell — your new command-line playground.
      This black box in front of you? That's your **terminal**, and it's ready to listen. Let's test if it's awake.
      🔍 Type this command exactly and press Enter:
      ```powershell
      Get-Process
      ```
      This command asks PowerShell to show you a list of everything that's currently running on your system. Neat, right?
    expectedCommand: Get-Process
    hint: |
      🔎 Try typing:
      ```powershell
      Get-Process
      ```
      That's the PowerShell way of saying "Show me what's running!"

      ❌ If you're stuck: Make sure to type `Get-Process` exactly.

      Great job! 🥳
      Let's teach your terminal to *speak back to you*. There's a friendly little command called `Write-Host` that does just that.
      🎯 Try saying hello like this:
      ```powershell
      Write-Host "Hello, world!"
      ```
    expectedCommand: Write-Host "Hello, world!"
    hint: |
      ✨ Try:
      ```powershell
      Write-Host "Hello, world!"
      ```
      Make sure the quotes are straight and the spacing is exact.

      ❌ Not quite! Make sure your command looks like: `Write-Host "Hello, world!"`

    title: Try Saying Something Else
    instructions: |
      Now it's your turn! 🎤
      Say **anything** to your terminal using `Write-Host`.
      👇 Example:
      ```powershell
      Write-Host "PowerShell is awesome!"
      ```
      Pick your own phrase — just be sure to use `Write-Host` and wrap it in quotes.
    expectedCommand: Write-Host "PowerShell is awesome!"
    validation:
      type: regex
      pattern: ^Write-Host\s+"[^"]+"
      caseSensitive: false
    hint: |
      💡 Try something like:
      ```powershell
      Write-Host "Learning is fun!"
      ```
      You can replace the text inside the quotes.

      ❌ Remember to use `Write-Host` with *quotes* around your message.
