  # PowerShell Command Challenge
  
  It's time to test your knowledge of basic PowerShell commands! This challenge will help reinforce what you learned in the "First Steps: Welcome to PowerShell" tutorial.
  
  ## Your Task
  
  Write a PowerShell command that accomplishes ALL of the following:
  
  1. Get the current date and time
  2. Format it to show ONLY the current hour and minute
  3. Store the result in a variable called $currentTime
  4. Display the value of $currentTime with a message saying "The current time is: "
  
  Hints:
  - You'll need to use Get-Date with a format parameter
  - The format string for hour:minute is "HH:mm"
  - Use $currentTime to store the result
  - Use double quotes to include the variable in your message
  
  Good luck!

solution: "$currentTime = Get-Date -Format \"HH:mm\"; \"The current time is: $currentTime\""
validation_type: "fuzzy"
hint: "Use Get-Date with the -Format parameter to format the date, store it in $currentTime, then use string interpolation with double quotes to display the message with the variable."
